# 1.8_Pvp-Plugin
This plugin allows you to perform 1.8 pvp in 1.17 (note that I did not remove shields from the game or added back 1.8 blocking)

Features:
- Calculates your damage based on your weapon, enchantments, crit, and potion effects (1.8 values)
- Removes the attack cooldown (you can still see it but trust me you still do full damage)

Things to Note:
- Shields are still in the game
- There are no visual changes
- No 1.8 blocking
- Strength is not calculated
